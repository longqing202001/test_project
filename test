In the past decade, cross-border e-commerce has grown tremendously, becoming a foundational part of global trade. Amazon is a key platform in this sphere. Since its launch in China in 2015, its "Global Selling" service has rapidly become a primary channel for Chinese sellers to expand internationally. Currently, Amazon has opened 20 major marketplaces worldwide to Chinese sellers (Amazon Global Selling, 2024). The platform's appeal is evident in the influence of its eventsâ€”a 2024 forum on brand expansion attracted over 100,000 Chinese sellers (Amazon Global Selling, 2024). This substantial seller base highlights the importance of studying Sino-US cross-cultural communication on Amazon. For instance, a shopkeeper in Shenzhen selling homemade phone cases shipped over 1,200 orders to the US within half a year. While impressive, managing this volume is challenging for a small team. The low barrier to entry means a seller from a small Chinese city can now compete with retailers on New York's Fifth Avenue, representing a significant shift in the retail landscape.
However, high sales volumes bring challenges. Each order can generate a surprising amount of communication. Customers inquire about product quality, shipping speed, return policies, and even packaging color. Sellers often reply promptly with return information, coupons, or shipment updates. The core issue lies in differing expectations: American buyers typically prefer direct, fast, and straightforward communication, while Chinese sellers might prioritize politeness and long-term relationship building. Both styles are reasonable within their cultural contexts, but these differences become daunting during problems like delays or refunds. For example, a delayed shipment can trigger scores of emails from an angry buyer, creating a communication vortex for the seller.
