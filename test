In the past decade, the growth of cross-border e-commerce has increased tremendously and is a foundational part of global trade. Amazon is a key platform for global cross-border e-commerce. Since its launch in China in 2015, its "Global Selling" service has rapidly become the primary channel for Chinese sellers to expand their international presence. Currently, Amazon has opened up access to 20 major marketplaces worldwide, spanning North America, Europe, and Asia, to Chinese sellers (Amazon Global Selling, 2024). The platform's immense appeal to Chinese sellers is evident simply in the influence of its official events—for example, a 2024 forum on brand expansion attracted over 100,000 Chinese sellers (Amazon Global Selling, 2024). This substantial seller base highlights the crucial practical significance of studying cross-cultural communication issues between China and the United States on the Amazon platform. Last year, I chatted with a shopkeeper in Shenzhen who sells homemade phone cases. In just half a year, they had shipped over 1,200 orders to buyers across Texas to Massachusetts. That is great, but it is a ton of work for a small team to navigate alone. Platforms are easy to get started, and all of a sudden, a seller in a small city in China can compete with a retailer on Fifth Avenue in New York, or Rodeo Drive in La. New territory for sure.
However, nothing is perfect, and high sales volumes bring their own set of challenges. Each order—and each tracking number—requires a small quantity of Universe-sized communication. Customers want to know about product quality, shipping speed, return policy, and sometimes even the packaging colour! Sellers would reply all in a hurry with return policy information, offer coupons, or inquire about shipment. However, the issue is that an American buyer wants one, two, or three communications: direct, fast, and straightforward. Whereas Chinese sellers reply with a polite, 'We will do it gradually, long-term relationship. Both are logical! However, it proves incredibly daunting in the event of a delay, refunds, and so on. There are sellers I know who have seen a delayed shipment lead to scores of emails flying back and forth because an item did not arrive on time, and the buyer was angry.
